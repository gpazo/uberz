Project: Food trucks
Technical track: back-end

I chose the food truck project because I haven't worked with the google maps API and decided it would be fun and challenging to take a step into new territory.  I originally began working with the SF movies project but after trying to geocode each location, as none of the addresses were in the standard long/lat format, I decided to go with the food truck API.  The API was pretty clean and allowed me to manipulate the data into the infoWindow objects allowing a clean view of the menu and food truck offerings. The project didn't specifically ask for geolocation but I thought it seemed pretty odd to center the map on an arbitrary location when the user will open it and expect to see results nearby. I went with a basic HTML5 browser geolocation, if I had more time I'd add more error checking and possibly a different render option as the page will not load if there is an error polling their location.  I left out a cleaner front-end with searchable location names, say you knew the name of the food truck but not where it is parked my webpage wouldn't be very helpful. Overall the project was pretty fun, I got to learn a little bit more about the city of San Francisco and a good geography lesson if nothing else!
